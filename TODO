- Points calculators (nutritional information -> Pro Points, old Points -> Pro Points).
-- Provide a Calculation model and controller that the client-side Javascript can delegate to,
   as I don't like that the calculation domain logic is separate from the other domain logic,
   which is specified in Rails.

Possible refactorings
- Switch to JQuery ahead of Rails 3.1
- Switch to SASS and Coffeescript when Rails 3.1 is released

Possible features
- Deleting entries? (Can do this via the console for now)
- Highlight when exceeding daily / weekly allowances? (Can do this pretty quickly by sight though...)
- Templates (so I don't have to enter breakfast and lunch in the week, which are often the same)?
- Reminders to nag when not filling in the trackers for a day or two?
