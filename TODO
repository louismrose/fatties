- Is anything further needed to support Pro Points?
- Points calculators (nutritional information -> Pro Points, old Points -> Pro Points).
-- Push points calculation to client side with Javascript

Possible features
- Deleting entries? (Can do this via the console for now)
- Highlight when exceeding daily / weekly allowances? (Can do this pretty quickly by sight though...)
- Templates (so I don't have to enter breakfast and lunch in the week, which are often the same)?
- Reminders to nag when not filling in the trackers for a day or two?
